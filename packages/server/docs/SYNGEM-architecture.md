# SYNGEM — Architecture Reference

> Last meaningful update: 2026-06-01 — Deterministic creature AI: `creature-ai.ts` replaces Haiku-driven creature decision-making. `resolveCreatureAction(pools)` returns `{ attackChoice, defendChoice }` based on will-vs-power comparison — no LLM calls in the combat loop. Combat UX: click-to-retarget enemy cards, floating red damage number + cyan block `[N AC]` overlay on hits (visible even on 0-damage attacks), player pool strip shows floating damage + AC popup on incoming attacks, inline error strip when GM server is unreachable. Dev harness supports multiple instances of the same creature type. Test creatures added to seed.

---

## Overview

The GM server is an Express app (port 3001) that implements the **SYNGEM** (Synthetic Game Master) pipeline — a 5-layer system that processes each player message through deterministic context building, mechanical intent parsing, streamed narrative generation, async world-state writeback, and periodic summarization.

The web app never calls Claude directly — it proxies all GM traffic through `POST /api/gm` → `POST /gm` on this server. The server holds the Supabase service role key. The Anthropic API key can be either the server-side `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var (dev/server flow) or a per-user BYOK key supplied via the `X-Anthropic-Key` request header (player flow). See [BYOK.md](./BYOK.md) for the full key lifecycle.

Conversation turns are **persisted server-side** in the `conversation_turns` table. The client no longer maintains or sends `conversationHistory`.

```

---

## Check Interruption Flow

When the Lore-Engine determines an action requires a pool check, execution halts **before the Architect runs**. The server returns JSON instead of SSE:

```json
{ "type": "check_required", "difficulty": 20, "pool": "Power", "check_description": "Forcing the iron gate" }
```

The client renders an inline panel with two options:
- **Spend from pool** → auto-succeed (no RNG)
- **Roll dice** → client rolls d10, sends result back

The player's resolution is sent in the next request as `checkResolution`:
```typescript
{ choice: 'spend' | 'roll', pool: 'Power' | 'Essence' | 'Will', roll_result?: number }
```

The Architect then incorporates the outcome into its narrative.

---

## Models Used

| Component | Model | Temp | max_tokens | Mode |
|-----------|-------|------|-----------|------|
| Lore-Engine | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | 0.0 | 300 | sync, JSON |
| Architect | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 0.5 | 1024 | streamed |
| Ledger | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 0.0 | 500 | async, JSON |
| Scribe | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | 0.5 | 1500 | async, JSON |
| Character Creator | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 0.9 | 2000 | sync, JSON (pre-game, POST /character-creator) |
| Generic eval | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | — | configurable | sync |

---

## Layer 1: Auto-Hydrator (`gm/auto-hydrator.ts`)

Deterministic function. Builds a `ContextBlock` from multiple parallel DB reads.

**Fetches (all in parallel):**
- `getFullCharacter()` — character + inventory + skills + spells
- `getGameWithMembers()` — game state (multiplayer only; skipped for solo SYNGEM)
- `getActiveEncounter()` — if `game.is_in_combat === true`
- `getNpcsForGame()` — game-scoped NPCs (multiplayer path; empty for solo SYNGEM)
- `getNpcsForCharacter()` — companion NPCs (`following_character_id = characterId`); always fetched regardless of gameId. Deduped and merged with game NPCs before enrichment.
- `quest_templates` — `description_gm` for each active quest → `activeQuestNotes[]`
- `world_entities` — location entities matching character's current location hierarchy
- `player_entity_mutations` — per-player overrides; mutations override base entity descriptions
- `improvised_entities` — character-scoped scene objects at the current location (`parent_id = location_place`). Surfaced to the Architect as `=== SCENE OBJECTS ===`. See [Improvised Entities](#improvised-entities-improvised_entities-table).

**NPC enrichment (`enrichAndFilterNpcs`):**
For each NPC, the Auto-Hydrator computes a routine-based placement using `computeNpcRoutineLocation()` (reads `personality_profile.routine` + current `game_time_minutes` → time slot → location_id). If the NPC's computed location matches the player's location, it appears in context. If the NPC's DB `current_location_id` differs from the computed location, a fire-and-forget update is issued. NPCs with `following_character_id = characterId` appear regardless of location (including companion NPCs with `game_id = null`). The result is `EnrichedNpc[]` — NPCs stripped down to what the Architect needs: name, title, faction, disposition label, last encounter summary, current task, and following status.

**Produces semantic pool tags** (on top of raw numbers):
| Ratio | Tag |
|-------|-----|
| > 75% | `Full` |
| 50–75% | `Moderate` |
| 25–50% | `Low` |
| ≤ 25% | `Critical` |

**Location entity resolution:** Queries `world_entities` using `current_location_building` → siblings at same parent → fallback to `place_context` → fallback to `region_context`. Applies `player_entity_mutations` overrides on `short_description`.

---

## Layer 2: Lore-Engine (`gm/agents/lore-engine.ts`)

Haiku sub-agent. Receives the last 2 turns + serialized `ContextBlock` + player input. Returns strict JSON.

**Slug:** `"lore-engine"` — loaded via `services/prompt-service.ts`. Falls back to `FALLBACK_SYSTEM` if no DB version found.

**Output schema:**
```typescript
{
  action_type: 'info' | 'task' | 'attack'
  requires_check: boolean
  difficulty?: number          // 0–50
  pool?: 'Power' | 'Essence' | 'Will'
  check_description?: string
  search_objects?: Array<{ action: string; target: string; container: string }>
  narrative_notes?: string     // hints passed to Architect
}
```

If `requires_check: true` and no `checkResolution` present → pipeline halts, returns `CheckRequired` to client.

**Search behavior differs by action type:**

- `action_type: 'info'` → handler calls `searchLoreInHierarchy(keyword, locationId)` for each search object. This performs a **two-phase hierarchical search**:
  1. **Global entities** (`parent_id IS NULL`) — general lore, history, mechanics. First match returned.
  2. **Location hierarchy** — searches within the player's current `location_place`, escalating to region then nation if nothing found. Up to 3 results (randomly sampled if more). Returns `long_description`.
  - If nothing found at any level: returns `"What the player asked about is unknown"`.
  - All results (global + local) are combined and passed to the Architect as `searchResults`.

- `action_type: 'task'` or `'attack'` with `search_objects` → flat `searchWorldEntities()` RPC call, `short_description`, up to 3 results.

---

## Layer 3: Style Modulator (`gm/style-modulator.ts`)

Deterministic. Reads one of `N` style files at random from `gm/content/`:
- `style_1.txt` — Restrained, observational
- `style_2.txt` — Lyrical, elegiac
- `style_3.txt` — Terse, consequential

Each file contains the same factual payload (Kataba rules, magic, history) written in a different prose register. Adding a `style_4.txt` will automatically be picked up.

To update style content, edit the `.txt` files directly or use the prompt builder to draft, then paste.

---

## Layer 4: Architect (`gm/agents/architect.ts`)

Sonnet. Streamed. **No tools.** Pure narrative generation.

**Slug:** `architect1` — loaded via `loadArchitectPrompt()` in `services/prompt-service.ts`. Fetches the latest version of that slug (cached 60 s). Falls back to the style file from `style-modulator.ts` if no DB entry exists for `architect1`.

**GM quest notes:** If `contextBlock.activeQuestNotes` is non-empty, the auto-hydrator has fetched `quest_templates.description_gm` for each active quest. These are injected as a system block labeled `=== ACTIVE QUEST CONTEXT (GM ONLY — do not reveal to player) ===`. This gives the Architect the full narrative scope of a quest (what the waystone actually points to, antagonist motivations, hidden truths) without those facts appearing in player-visible quest text.

**Scene objects:** If `contextBlock.improvisedEntities` is non-empty, a `=== SCENE OBJECTS ===` section is added to the character state block listing objects and NPCs that the Architect previously introduced for this character at the current location. This ensures continuity — an object improvised in a prior session will still be referenced as present on subsequent visits.

Returns an `AsyncGenerator<string>` of text chunks. The `handler.ts` yields each chunk to the Express route, which forwards them as SSE events:

```
data: {"chunk": "The gate groaned"}\n\n
data: {"chunk": " under your hands."}\n\n
data: {"done": true}\n\n
```

The Architect receives no tool definitions — all mechanical work happens in the Lore-Engine (pre) and Ledger (post). Its only job is to write.

---

## Layer 5: Ledger + State Executor

### Ledger (`gm/agents/ledger.ts`)
Sonnet. Async (fire-and-forget). Reads the completed Architect narrative and determines if permanent world state changed.

**Slug:** `"ledger"` — loaded via `services/prompt-service.ts`. Falls back to `FALLBACK_SYSTEM` if no DB version found.

Returns a `LedgerOutput[]` array:
```typescript
type LedgerOutput =
  | { action: 'move_character'; destination_entity_id: string }
  | { action: 'update_entity'; entity_id: string; mutations: Record<string, unknown> }
  | { action: 'update_npc'; npc_id: string; mutations: NpcMutations }
  | { action: 'create_entity'; entity: Record<string, unknown> }
  | { action: 'delete_entity'; entity_id: string; replacement_description: string }
  | { action: 'grant_item'; item_name: string; item_type: string; description?: string; quantity?: number }
```

Only records **permanent, world-altering changes** — not narrative flourishes.

**`create_entity` vs `grant_item`:** The Ledger is instructed to distinguish between objects that exist in the world environment (`create_entity`) and items that enter the player's possession (`grant_item`). An improvised chest in a corner → `create_entity`. An NPC handing the player a dagger → `grant_item`.

The Ledger receives the character's current `locationContext` (place, region, nation names) in the user message so it can write more precise entity IDs and descriptions.

`update_npc` is only emitted for semantically significant NPC events: disposition shifts (player bribed/angered/charmed an NPC), revealed information, task assignments, death, or explicit departure. Routine NPC movement is handled deterministically by the Auto-Hydrator and is never a Ledger concern.

### State Executor (`gm/state-executor.ts`)
Deterministic. Validates and executes Ledger output against the DB.

| Action | DB Operation |
|--------|-------------|
| `move_character` | Validates entity is a location type, calls `updateCharacter()` with new location fields |
| `update_entity` | Merges `mutations` into existing `world_entities.data` JSON |
| `update_npc` | Calls `updateNpcMutations()` in `world-service.ts` — merges disposition delta (clamped to [-100,100]), overwrites `personality_profile.memory.last_encounter_summary`, appends to `known_facts` (cap 8), updates task/location/alive/following |
| `create_entity` | Three-step dedup: (1) if ID exists in `world_entities` → merge new data only; (2) if ID exists in `improvised_entities` for this character → merge data; (3) otherwise → insert into `improvised_entities` with location context backfilled from character's current position |
| `delete_entity` | Upserts into `player_entity_mutations` with `{hidden: true, short_description: ...}` |
| `grant_item` | Finds or creates an `items` template row by name (case-insensitive); inserts into `character_inventory` with `quantity`, `condition: 100`, `is_equipped: false` |

Errors are logged and swallowed — a Ledger failure never crashes a player turn.

---

## Layer 6: Scribe (`gm/agents/summary.ts` → `runScribe`)

Haiku. Async. Triggered server-side every 4 player turns. **Slug:** `"scribe"` — loaded via `services/prompt-service.ts`. Falls back to `FALLBACK_SYSTEM` if no DB version found. (based on `conversation_turns.turn_number % 4 === 0`).

**Before calling the model**, the Scribe fetches `quest_templates.stages` for all active quests. These stage definitions (with `completion_hints`) are injected into the prompt so the model can accurately detect when a stage has been reached.

**Outputs four things in a single JSON response (`quest_updates` replaces the old flat `quest_objectives`):**
1. `summary` → written to `syngem_game.summary` — exponentially compressed narrative prose. Fed back to Architect as "Story So Far."
2. `quest_updates.objectives` → written to `characters.quest_objectives` — updated array including `current_stage` advancement. The model preserves `grants_applied` (owned by the Quest Engine) and updates `description` (player-facing) and `current_stage` (internal stage tracker).
3. `quest_updates.completed_quest_ids` → returned to `handler.ts` to trigger `applyQuestCompletionGrants()` for any newly completed quests.
4. `key_entity_ids` → written to `characters.key_entity_ids` — entity IDs the player interacted with.

**Return value:** `{ completedQuestIds: string[] }` — handler uses this to fire completion grants post-Scribe.

Can be triggered manually via `POST /gm/scribe` with `{ characterId }`.

---

## Conversation State

Turns are **persisted server-side** in the `conversation_turns` table:

```sql
id, character_id, game_id, role ('player'|'assistant'), content, turn_number, created_at
```

The handler fetches turns directly from DB — the client sends no conversation history. This means:
- History survives page refreshes
- Multiple browser tabs don't diverge
- The Lore-Engine always gets the true last 2 turns; the Architect gets the true last 4

**Prompt service (`services/prompt-service.ts`):** Fetches the latest version of any sub-agent's system prompt from `prompt_versions` by slug. Results are cached in memory for 60 seconds. If no DB version exists, the agent falls back to a hardcoded `FALLBACK_SYSTEM` constant. All four sub-agents (Lore-Engine, Architect, Ledger, Scribe) load their prompts through this service.

---

## Server Endpoints

| Method | Path | Handler | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `POST` | `/gm` | `handleGMMessage()` | Main pipeline. Returns SSE stream or `{type:'check_required'}` JSON |
| `POST` | `/gm/quest/start` | `applyQuestStartGrants()` | Fires quest start grants (items + companion NPCs). Body: `{ characterId, questId }`. Called by frontend after character creation |
| `POST` | `/gm/summarize` | `summarizeHistory()` | Legacy endpoint. Returns `{summary}` text only (no DB write) |
| `POST` | `/gm/scribe` | `runScribe()` | Manual Scribe trigger. Writes summary + quest + entities to DB |
| `POST` | `/eval` | Claude eval service | Single-shot, no tools — used by dev prompt tools |
| `GET` | `/health` | — | `{ status: 'ok' }` |
| `POST` | `/dev/log-level` | `setLogLevel()` | Dev only. Sets in-memory log level. Body: `{ level: 'verbose' \| 'errors+' \| 'errors' \| 'silent' }` |

---

## BYOK Architecture

Players supply their own Anthropic API key. The key is stored in the browser's `localStorage` only and is never written to the database.

### Request flow

```
Browser localStorage
  → X-Anthropic-Key HTTP header (HTTPS)
    → Next.js /api/gm (in-memory, not logged)
      → GM server index.ts (in-memory, not logged)
        → createClaudeClient(anthropicApiKey?)
          → one Anthropic instance per request
            → discarded after request completes
```

If no `X-Anthropic-Key` header is present, `createClaudeClient()` falls back to `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — the original dev/server-side flow.

### Client instantiation

Previously each agent module held a **module-level singleton** (`const client = new Anthropic()`). This has been replaced with a **per-request client** created once in `handler.ts` and passed as an optional `client?` parameter to every agent function. The agent falls back to `createClaudeClient()` with no argument if no client is passed (supports isolated unit tests and CLI usage).

### Token tracking

After each agent call, `recordTokenUsage()` is called fire-and-forget with the `response.usage` counts. For the streaming Architect, usage is captured via `stream.finalMessage().usage` after the generator is fully consumed. The write goes to `token_usage` (user_id, character_id, agent name, model, input/output counts). **The API key is never a parameter to this function.**

### Budget enforcement

`checkBudget(userId)` runs at the top of the handler (after ownership check, before everything else). It:
1. Reads `profiles.token_budget` — `null` means unlimited.
2. Aggregates `SUM(input_tokens + output_tokens)` from `token_usage` for the user.
3. If `currentUsage >= budgetCap`, yields a budget error message and halts the pipeline.

### Audit files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gm/claude-client.ts` | `createClaudeClient(apiKey?)` — the only place an `Anthropic` instance is constructed |
| `gm/record-token-usage.ts` | `recordTokenUsage()` — writes token counts only, never the key |
| `gm/budget-guard.ts` | `checkBudget(userId)` — reads cap + aggregate, returns `allowed` bool |

See [BYOK.md](./BYOK.md) for the full security narrative and what NOT to log.

---

## Database Tables (New)

### `token_usage` (new — BYOK)
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `user_id` | uuid | FK → auth.users (ON DELETE CASCADE) |
| `character_id` | uuid? | FK → characters (ON DELETE SET NULL) |
| `agent` | text | `'lore-engine'` \| `'architect'` \| `'ledger'` \| `'scribe'` \| … |
| `model` | text | Anthropic model ID |
| `input_tokens` | integer | |
| `output_tokens` | integer | |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | |

RLS: authenticated users can SELECT their own rows. All inserts are performed by the GM server via the service role (bypasses RLS). No UPDATE/DELETE policies — append-only.

### New column on `profiles`
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `token_budget` | integer? | `null` = unlimited. Min 1,000 enforced at the API route level. |

---

## Improvised Entities (`improvised_entities` table)

Architect hallucinations that introduce new objects, NPCs, or environmental features are embraced as world-building — but they must not pollute the shared `world_entities` table with per-character noise. The `improvised_entities` table stores character-scoped creations.

### Design

- **Composite PK `(character_id, id)`** — the same entity slug (e.g. `item_obsidian_vial`) can exist independently for different characters without collision.
- **`parent_id → world_entities.id`** — improvised entities are always anchored to a canonical location. The State Executor backfills `parent_id` from the character's `location_place` when the Ledger doesn't include it.
- **`world_entities` stays canonical** — only seeded / admin-created content lives there. `create_entity` checks it first; if the ID already exists there it merges data instead of creating a duplicate.
- **Read path** — the Auto-Hydrator queries `improvised_entities` filtered to the current location and character, surfacing them as `ContextBlock.improvisedEntities`.
- **Write path** — `state-executor.createEntity()` only writes to `improvised_entities`. If the Architect references an object that was previously created, the existing row is updated (merge semantics).

### Schema

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | varchar(64) | Part of composite PK; snake_case slug |
| `character_id` | uuid | Part of composite PK; FK → `characters.id` ON DELETE CASCADE |
| `name` | varchar(255) | |
| `type` | entity_type | Reuses `world_entities` enum: `nation\|region\|place\|location\|npc\|item` |
| `parent_id` | varchar(64)? | FK → `world_entities.id` ON DELETE SET NULL; anchors to canonical location |
| `nation_context` | varchar(255)? | Denormalized from character's location |
| `region_context` | varchar(255)? | Denormalized from character's location |
| `place_context` | varchar(255)? | Denormalized from character's location |
| `data` | jsonb | Descriptions, flags, etc. |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | |

Migration: `20260601000000_add_improvised_entities.sql`

RLS: authenticated users SELECT (all rows; filtered by character_id in application code). GM server writes via service role (bypasses RLS).

---

### `prompt_versions` (updated)
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `name` | text | Human-readable label |
| `slug` | text | Agent identifier (`lore-engine`, `architect`, `ledger`, `scribe`) |
| `version` | integer | Auto-incremented per slug per user |
| `prompt` | jsonb | `{ blocks: [{kind, label, content}], model, maxTokens, temperature }` |
| `description` | text? | Optional description of what this version does |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | |
| `created_by` | uuid | FK → auth.users |

---

### `conversation_turns`
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `character_id` | uuid | FK → characters |
| `game_id` | uuid? | FK → games |
| `role` | text | `'player'` or `'assistant'` |
| `content` | text | Full message content |
| `turn_number` | integer | Monotonically increasing per character |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | |

### New columns on `characters`
| Column | Type | Written by |
|--------|------|-----------|
| `scribe_summary` | text | Scribe (every 4 turns) |
| `quest_objectives` | jsonb | Scribe |
| `key_entity_ids` | text[] | Scribe |
| `ai_game` | boolean | Feature flag |
| `gm_history` | jsonb | Legacy — superseded by `conversation_turns` |

---

## Dev Logging (`gm/logger.ts`)

All pipeline diagnostic output goes through `synLog(tag, msg, detail?)`. In production (`NODE_ENV=production`) the function is a no-op. In dev, it appends to a daily rotating log file:

```
packages/server/logs/syngem-YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

The directory is created automatically on first write. Log files are gitignored.

**Log entry format:**
```
2026-05-27T14:23:01.456Z [LORE-ENGINE] ✓ action:task requires_check:false notes:"player moves north"
              {
                "action_type": "task",
                "requires_check": false,
                "narrative_notes": "player moves north"
              }
```
A blank line is inserted before each new pipeline request (`[HANDLER] → request`) for visual separation.

**Log levels** — controlled at runtime via `setLogLevel()`:

| Level | What is written |
| ------- | --------------- |
| `verbose` | Everything — all `synLog` calls including `detail` blocks |
| `errors+` | Lines starting with `⚠`/`✗`, plus any call with a `detail` block (the parsed JSON outputs) |
| `errors` | Only lines starting with `⚠` or `✗` |
| `silent` | Nothing |

Default level: `verbose`.

**Changing the level at runtime:**

- Dashboard: the **Log Level** radio group in the dev section (visible when dev mode is toggled on, `isDev` flag required)
- Direct call: `POST /dev/log-level` with `{ "level": "errors+" }`
- The setting is stored in localStorage and synced to the server on page load, so it survives refreshes

The chosen level is stored in the express process's memory — restarting the server resets it to `verbose`.

---

## Failure Modes

- **Lore-Engine returns bad JSON** — `runLoreEngine()` catches parse errors and falls back to `{ action_type: 'task', requires_check: false }`. The full raw model response is written to the log file. Pipeline continues.
- **Architect stream fails mid-way** — partial text is already sent to the client. The handler catches and sends `{"error": "GM handler failed"}` as the final SSE event.
- **Ledger returns bad JSON or empty** — `runLedger()` returns `[]`. State Executor is never called. The full raw model response is written to the log file. Narrative is unaffected.
- **State Executor action fails** — each action is wrapped in try/catch. Failures are written to the log file. One failing action (e.g., entity not found) doesn't block others.
- **Scribe / GameTime / Ledger async errors** — all `.catch` handlers write to the log file via `synLog`. Characters retain their previous scribe data until the next successful Scribe run.
- **`prompt_versions` has no entry for a slug** — agents fall back to their hardcoded `FALLBACK_SYSTEM` (Architect falls back to the style-modulator text). Add the slug via the prompt builder to override. For the Architect, the `architect1` slug must have at least one version to avoid style-text fallback.

---

## NPC System

NPCs live in the dedicated `npcs` table (not `world_entities`) because they require game-scoped state (`game_id`), per-NPC disposition, and structured metadata not suited to the hierarchical entity model.

### Data model

All NPC-specific state beyond the base columns is stored in `personality_profile: Json`:

```json
{
  "personality": "Gruff and suspicious of outsiders.",
  "home_location_id": "loc_karkill_barracks",
  "routine": {
    "morning":   "loc_karkill_mess_hall",
    "afternoon": "loc_karkill_training_grounds",
    "evening":   "loc_karkill_flounder_inn"
  },
  "memory": {
    "last_encounter_summary": "Player asked about the stolen crown. Guard was unhelpful.",
    "known_facts": ["Player is hunting the crown", "Player has 200 gold"],
    "last_encounter_tick": 42,
    "relationship_arc": "indifferent → suspicious"
  },
  "current_task": {
    "description": "Patrol the docks for suspicious activity",
    "target_location_id": "loc_karkill_docks",
    "assigned_tick": 120
  }
}
```

`memory` is bounded — `last_encounter_summary` overwrites on each significant interaction; `known_facts` caps at 8 entries (oldest drop off). No verbatim history is stored.

### Lazy simulation (Anti-Skyrim)

NPCs are not simulated in real time. Instead, the Auto-Hydrator computes a plausible location on demand:

1. `game_time_minutes` maps to a time slot: `night` (0–359), `morning` (360–719), `afternoon` (720–1079), `evening` (1080–1439).
2. The NPC's `routine[slot]` gives the expected location. Falls back to `home_location_id`, then to `current_location_id`.
3. If the expected location matches the player's location, the NPC appears in context. A fire-and-forget DB update keeps `current_location_id` current.
4. NPCs whose `following_character_id = characterId` appear in every location context regardless of routine.

NPCs out of the player's view cease to exist in the simulation until the player encounters them again.

### NPC columns

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | text | snake_case slug |
| `game_id` | uuid? | FK → games. **Nullable** — companion NPCs (e.g. Brin) have `game_id = null` and are linked solely via `following_character_id` |
| `name` | text | |
| `title` | text? | |
| `faction` | text? | |
| `current_location_id` | text | Updated lazily by Auto-Hydrator |
| `following_character_id` | uuid? | FK → characters; null = not following |
| `disposition_to_players` | int? | [-100, 100]; updated by Ledger `update_npc` |
| `is_alive` | bool? | |
| `last_seen_tick` | int? | Reserved for future narrative use |
| `personality_profile` | jsonb | See structure above |
| `attribute_modifiers` | jsonb | Stat overrides for combat |

### Assigning tasks and following

- **Task:** Ledger emits `update_npc` with `current_task`. The Architect narrates progress when the player asks; no real simulation occurs.
- **Following:** Ledger emits `update_npc` with `following_character_id = characterId`. Auto-Hydrator includes the NPC in every subsequent turn until cleared.

---

## Quest Engine (`services/quest-engine.ts`)

The Quest Engine handles mechanical grants triggered by quest events. It runs outside the main pipeline — never blocking a player turn.

### Quest templates (`quest_templates` table)

Each quest is defined as a DB row:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `id` | text | Slug, e.g. `follow_the_waystone` |
| `title` | text | Display name |
| `description_gm` | text | Full GM backstory — injected into Architect context, never shown to player |
| `stages` | jsonb | Array of `{id, title, description, completion_hints[]}` — used by Scribe to detect progression |
| `start_grants` | jsonb | `{items: [{item_id, quantity, condition}], npcs: [{name, title, ...}]}` |
| `completion_grants` | jsonb | `{skill_points, denarius, items: [...]}` |

### `characters.quest_objectives` extended schema

The Scribe writes — and the Quest Engine reads — an extended objective shape:

```typescript
{
  id: string            // quest template slug
  title: string
  status: "active" | "completed" | "failed"
  description: string   // player-facing, updated each Scribe run
  current_stage?: string  // current stage id — advanced by Scribe
  grants_applied?: string[] // ["start", "completion"] — owned by Quest Engine, Scribe never modifies
}
```

### Grant lifecycle

```
syngem-intro.tsx  →  POST /api/gm/quest/start  →  applyQuestStartGrants()
                       ├ fetch quest_templates.start_grants
                       ├ insert items into character_inventory
                       ├ insert NPC with game_id=null, following_character_id=characterId
                       └ mark grants_applied: ["start"] in quest_objectives

handler.ts (post-Scribe)  →  applyQuestCompletionGrants()
                              ├ fetch quest_templates.completion_grants
                              ├ insert bonus items into character_inventory
                              ├ increment characters.unused_skill_points
                              ├ increment characters.denarius
                              └ mark grants_applied: ["start", "completion"]
```

Both functions are **idempotent** — they check `grants_applied` before acting. Safe to call multiple times.

### The Waystone Quest (`follow_the_waystone`)

The first and currently only quest. Seeded by migration `20260529200000_add_quest_engine.sql`.

- **Start grants:** The Waystone item, a worn backpack, travel rations ×3, oilskin tarp, Brin NPC (companion)
- **Stages:** `arrive_in_karkill` → `night_in_town` → `meet_the_greycoats` → `follow_the_needle` → `the_clock_chamber` → `the_battle` → `completed`
- **Completion grants:** 3 skill points, 50 denarius (combat items TBD when combat is implemented)
- **`the_battle` stage:** Placeholder — completion_hints defined but no combat system yet

## Extending the Pipeline

### Adding a new style file
Drop a new `style_N.txt` in `gm/content/`. Update `STYLE_COUNT` in `gm/style-modulator.ts`.

### Updating an agent's system prompt
Use the prompt builder at `/dev/prompt-builder`. Save with the agent's slug:

| Agent | Slug(s) |
| ----- | ------- |
| Lore-Engine | `lore-engine` |
| Architect | `architect1` |
| Ledger | `ledger` |
| Scribe | `scribe` |
| Character Creator | `character-builder` |

The server loads the highest version for that slug, cached for 60 seconds. To force an immediate reload (e.g. during testing), call `invalidatePromptCache(slug)` from `services/prompt-service.ts`.

### Grading an agent's prompt
Use the **Agent Grader** at `/dev/prompt-eval`.

**How it works:**
1. Select an agent slug + version. The grader knows each agent's pipeline block sequence — system prompt, context blocks, history placeholder, and user input — and shows them in order in Column 1.
2. Select a character. Context blocks are hydrated via `POST /api/gm/hydrate` with the tables each agent actually uses. Blocks that return empty are flagged red; optional blocks (e.g. scribe summary) are flagged as placeholders.
3. Add test cases in Column 2. For agents that produce JSON, set expected output fields:
   - **Lore-Engine:** expected `action_type`, `requires_check`, `pool`
   - **Ledger:** list of expected actions (e.g. `long_rest`, `grant_item + weapon`)
   - **Scribe:** checkboxes for `summary`, `objectives` array, `completed_quest_ids` array
   - **Character Creator:** all 5 required fields checked automatically
   - **Architect:** no code grade (prose output)
4. Click **Run All Tests**. Each test case runs through:
   - **Agent eval** — prompt sent to `POST /api/gm/eval` with the agent's production model/tokens/temp locked
   - **Code grade** — `x/y` fields correct. Bumper-lane aliases count as passing (e.g. `rest` → `long_rest` = pass)
   - **Model grade** — mandatory Haiku 4.5 grader (max 200 tokens, temp 0) returns `score/100` + one-line review

The Run Log in Column 3 appends each run's results with the prompt version used, character name, and per-test grades.

**Grader model configs (locked to production values):**

| Agent | Graded model | Tokens | Temp |
|-------|-------------|--------|------|
| Lore-Engine | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | 300 | 0.0 |
| Architect | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 1024 | 0.5 |
| Ledger | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 500 | 0.0 |
| Scribe | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | 1500 | 0.5 |
| Character Creator | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 2000 | 0.9 |
| Grader (all agents) | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | 200 | 0.0 |

**Client-side bumper lanes** (`packages/web/lib/graders/bumper-lanes.ts`) — a copy of the server-side normalization maps used by the code grader. When the agent output uses an alias that the server would normalize (e.g. `moveto` instead of `move_character`), the code grader still marks it as a pass. Keep this file in sync with `packages/server/gm/bumper-lanes.ts` when adding new aliases.

### Adding a new State Executor action
1. Add to the `LedgerOutput` union type in `gm/types.ts`.
2. Update the Ledger's system prompt in `prompt_versions` (slug: `"ledger"`) to know about the new action.
3. Add the handler function and a new `case` in `executeStateChanges()` in `gm/state-executor.ts`.

### Teaching the bumper lanes (`gm/bumper-lanes.ts`)
Bumper lanes are pre-Zod normalization tables that catch slightly misaligned LLM output and redirect it to the canonical value. `collapse()` strips whitespace and lowercases before lookup, so `"GOLD"`, `"Gold"`, and `" gold "` all match the same entry.

| Table | Used by | Maps to |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| `LEDGER_ACTIONS` | `normalizeLedgerAction` | Canonical Ledger action names (e.g. `moveto` → `move_character`) |
| `ITEM_TYPES` | `normalizeLedgerAction` (on `grant_item`) | Canonical item types: `weapon`, `armor`, `consumable`, `misc`, `currency` |
| `LORE_ACTION_TYPES` | `normalizeLoreEngineRaw` | `info`, `task`, `attack` |
| `LORE_POOLS` | `normalizeLoreEngineRaw` | `Power`, `Essence`, `Will` |
| `QUEST_STATUSES` | `normalizeScribeRaw` | `active`, `completed`, `failed` |

**Currency aliases** — the game uses `denarius` as its currency unit. Both normalizers cover common LLM drift:

- `ITEM_TYPES` maps `gold`, `silver`, `money`, `dollars`, `coin`, `coins`, `denarius`, `denarii`, `currency` → `currency` (used when the LLM emits `grant_item` with a currency-type item)
- `normalizeStatName` in `gm/tools/index.ts` maps the same set → `denarius` column (used when the LLM calls `update_stat` with a currency stat)

To add a new alias: add a lowercase entry to the relevant table and its canonical target. No other changes needed.

### Extending NPC state
New NPC fields that don't require DB schema changes go into `personality_profile` JSON (update `NpcPersonalityProfile` in `gm/types.ts`, extend `NpcMutations` if the Ledger should write them, and handle in `updateNpcMutations()` in `world-service.ts`). New typed columns (like `following_character_id`) require a migration + `database.types.ts` update.

### Testing via CLI REPL
```bash
node --env-file=.env.local packages/server/chat.ts <character_id>
```
The REPL streams Architect output to stdout. Check interruptions are printed inline. Commands: `/stats`, `/quit`.
